# Street-Sensor-System
A model of a traffic intersection which can sense the presence of cars using 4 photoresistors. If a car is present at a traffic stop, the pair of lights perpendicular will turn from green to red, allowing the car to get a green light and be on its way.

The physical model was made using household materials (i.e. shoebox, paper), and the system itself is powered by Arduino, with the source code in this repository.
